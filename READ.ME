# Simple Stack Buffer Overflow for Vulnserver

Goal was to combine all the scripts needed to attack [Vulnserver](https://thegreycorner.com/vulnserver.html) with a
stack buffer overflow. main.py contains all you need, or you can use the other files as needed for a step
by step approach. Target_IP, and Offset should be the only values that need changed.
